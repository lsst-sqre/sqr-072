  Describes the design pattern and code structure the author uses for FastAPI
  web applications. This is only one possible approach, and is not a standard
  or requirement.

# Abstract, if available
abstract: |
  SQuaRE has standardized on Python with the FastAPI framework for writing web
  applications, and suggests a basic application structure via the FastAPI
  Safir App project template. These tools provide a solid starting foundation
  but leave numerous architectural decisions unresolved. This tech note
  collects design patterns and architectural approaches used by the author
  when constructing FastAPI applications, which may be of interest as a model
  (or cautionary tale) for others.

  Nothing described here is a project standard or requirement. It is only the
  personal opinion of the author.
